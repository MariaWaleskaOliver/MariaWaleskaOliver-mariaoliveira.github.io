# Computer Programmer 

Programming involves logical reasoning, curiosity, creativity, and, above all, the desire to solve problems in the best possible way, to simplify and/or improve a variety of tasks in our daily lives. During this first semester, we had the pleasure of developing new projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C# and UX. Which I have the pleasure of exhibiting in this portfolio.
